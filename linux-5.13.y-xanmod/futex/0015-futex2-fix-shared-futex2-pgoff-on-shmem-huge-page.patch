Subject: [PATCH] futex2: fix shared futex2 pgoff on shmem huge page

This commit is based on the commit fe19bd3dae3d15d2fbfdb3de8839a6ea0fe94264
original for futex.

If more than one futex2 is placed on a shmem huge page, it can happen
that waking the second wakes the first instead, and leaves the second
waiting: the key's index is wrong.

When 3.11 commit 13d60f4b6ab5 ("futex: Take hugepages into account when
generating futex_key"), the only shared huge pages came from hugetlbfs,
and the code added to deal with its exceptional page->index was put into
hugetlb source.  Then that was missed when 4.8 added shmem huge pages.

page_to_pgoff() is what others use for this nowadays: except that, as
currently written, it gives the right answer on hugetlbfs head, but
nonsense on hugetlbfs tails.  Fix that by calling hugetlbfs-specific
hugetlb_basepage_index() on PageHuge tails as well as on head.

Yes, it's unconventional to declare hugetlb_basepage_index() there in
pagemap.h, rather than in hugetlb.h; but I do not expect anything but
page_to_pgoff() ever to need it.

[akpm@linux-foundation.org: give hugetlb_basepage_index() prototype the correct scope]
